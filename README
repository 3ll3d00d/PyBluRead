PyBluRead -- A wrapper library around libbluray

This Python module wraps libbluray to provide Python access to BR structural information.
This does not fully wrap libbluray as my needs are not that extensive.

Please note that this module uses libbluray to directly access a DVD disc if the device path is provided.
This means that execution speed will depend on disc access, which can be slow. Just be aware of this.

	class Bluray(_bluread.Bluray)
	 |  Entry object into parsing Bluray structure.
	 |  Pass the device path to the init function, and then call Open() to initiate reading.
	 |  Also, provide a path to KEYDB.cfg file if you feel so inclined (which is passed through libbluray as libbluray does not decrypt).
	 |  
	 |  A Bluray has titles.
	 |  A Title has chapters.
